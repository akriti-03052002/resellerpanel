/* ============================================================
   BLOCK IF RESELLER PAYMENT RESTRICTED
   Resolved enforcement scope (RESELLER_COMPLETE_PLAN.md B12
   item 7): panel-access restriction ONLY, permanently — this
   system has no link to the Reseller's hardware/CMS at all, so
   there is no mechanism to reach further than this, and none
   should be built. A partner past their grace period loses the
   ability to allocate, register, activate, or purchase — already-
   running screens are untouched, since this system has no way to
   touch them either way.

   Mounted only on the specific mutating routes that should be
   blocked (see partnerResellerRoutes.js) — read-only routes and
   the invoice-payment route itself stay open so a restricted
   partner can still see their situation and pay their way out of it.
============================================================ */
